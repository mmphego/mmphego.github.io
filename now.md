Inspired by [Derek Sivers' /now page movement](https://sivers.org/now3), here's what I'm focused on right now in no particular order:


- Enrolled for a [Cloud Developer Nano degree with Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/cloud-developer-nanodegree--nd9990) and completed project 1 of 5.
- I've pledged to learn for at least 30 minutes for 30 days in the *#30DaysUdacity* challenge. Follow my journey: @mphomphego
- Constantly working to improve my side project: [Shopping list bot](https://github.com/users/mmphego/projects/1) and @easyequities portfolio updater.
- Contributing to open-source at least once a week, in order to maintain my position on [https://commits.top/south_africa.html](https://commits.top/south_africa.html)
- Attempting to build a writing habit by creating a new article every 2nd week on this blog.
- Reviving my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/MphoMphego1) and creating videos focused on Python/Linux/Git tips and tricks.
- Daily meditation as part of my "Year of Calm".
- During the month of January, I've vouched not to drink alcohol and my family is trying out a plant-based diet (However, the smell and taste of meat is...)
