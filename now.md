Inspired by [Derek Sivers' /now page movement](https://sivers.org/now3), here's what I'm focused on right now in no particular order:

- Daily meditation as part of my "Year of Calm".
- Iâ€™m currently learning more about *Applied Machine Learning* and, 
- Starting with [#100DaysOfML challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) in January, 2021 with the primary focus on [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow - Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40363665-hands-on-machine-learning-with-scikit-learn-keras-and-tensorflow) I recently bought.
- Finally finished reading: [AIQ: How People and Machines Are Smarter Together by Nick Polson, James Scott](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39328092-aiq) and would highly recommend it to anyone with interests in Data Science/ML/AI/DL
- Re-reading: [Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less by Greg McKeown](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077875-essentialism)
- Completed the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) course from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) [Completed 5 of 5 courses].
    - My progress can be accessed [here](https://github.com/mmphego/DeepLearning-AI) ;Not up-to-date
- Attempting to build a writing habit by creating a new article every 2nd week on this blog.
- Reviving my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/MphoMphego1) and creating videos focused on Python/Linux/Git tips and tricks.
    - My latest video is a tutorial on [Simplified Face Detection Implementation using OpenVINO in under 10 lines of code.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOG-6VfB2cI)
