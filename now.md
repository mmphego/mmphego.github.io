Inspired by [Derek Sivers' /now page movement](https://sivers.org/now3), here's what I'm focused on right now in no particular order:

- Daily meditation and Yoga as part of my "Year of Calm".
- I'm currently reading: [Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones by James Clear](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits)
- Currently mentoring and completing a number of [Udacity](https://imp.i115008.net/VyRr4M) courses.
  - [AWS Machine Learning Engineering Nanodegree](https://imp.i115008.net/VyRr4M) [Completed 4 of 6 projects].
  - [Digital Marketing Nanodegree](https://imp.i115008.net/do3X5K) [Completed 7 of 8 projects].
  - [Cloud Architect using Microsoft Azure](https://imp.i115008.net/7mLA1y) [Completed 1 of 3 projects].
- Constantly optimizing my blog site and improving SEO, as well as adding new features with the knowledge gained from Udacity's [Digital Marketing Nanodegree](https://imp.i115008.net/do3X5K)
- Attempting to build a writing habit by creating a new article every 2nd week on this blog.
- Reviving my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/MphoMphego1) and creating videos focused on Python/Linux/Git tips and tricks.
  - My latest video was a [Lunch 'n Learn: Lunch And Learn: Security Hardening For Your Docker Environment](https://bit.ly/3vbaVgp), which was a talk I gave to my colleagues and co-workers at the company I work for.
