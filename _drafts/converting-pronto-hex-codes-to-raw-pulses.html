<p>I'm really just getting my feet wet when it comes to IR protocols and IR codes in general, so my knowledge and understanding may be a bit shaky here.</p>
<p>I am a programmer and am trying to create a tool to convert Pronto Hex codes to RAW IR pulses. To do this I'm trying to understand the process manually. I'm testing this with an IR blaster app on a specific device.</p>
<p>What I have so far is the result of lots of searching, playing around with tools and piecing things together.</p>
<p>Considering the following HEX code:</p>
<p>0000 006E 0011 0006 0012 0052 0014 0051 0014<br />
0051 0014 0051 0013 0052 0013 0052 0024 0051<br />
0014 0031 0014 0052 0023 0052 0034 0051 0014<br />
0051 0014 0052 0013 0052 0013 0052 0014 0051<br />
0014 0632 0154 0051 0014 0CE5 0154 0051 0014<br />
0CE5 0154 0051 0014 0CE5</p>
<p>Here is pseudocode of what I have</p>
<p>I know the first set, "0000", indicates it's raw oscillated code. I believe the second set "006E" indicates the frequency for the code and can be converted to khz via:</p>
<p>freq = 1000000 / (toDecimal("006E") * .241246)</p>
<p>I know that the third and fourth sets of codes have to do with the sequence lengths.</p>
<p>I know the rest of the sets can be converted to pulses in microseconds with the following, using "0012" as an example</p>
<p>microSeconds = 1000000 * toDecimal("0012") / freq</p>
<p>So "0012" would be (rounded) 478. So, applying the above to the full code and separated with commas I end up with:</p>
<p>478,2176,531,2150,531,2150,531,2150,504,2176,504,2176,955,2150,531,1300,531,2176,929,2176,1380,2150,531,2150,531,2176,504,2176,504,2176,531,2150,531,42088,9023,2150,531,87599,9023,2150,531,87599,9023,2150,531,87599</p>
<p>When I test this out with an IR blaster I don't see the device I am trying to control respond. However if I prepend the opening pulses for NEC protocol 9000,4500 I get a response from my device.</p>
<p>My questions are - Could someone tell me if I am on the right track here? How would I discern from the HEX code that I needed to use the 9000 on 4500 as the opening pulses? Any input/advice would be really appreciated, as I've said I'm just getting my feet wet here. Thanks much!<br />
