    <span class="fa fa-code about-icon"></span>
    I created this blog to keep track of all of the things I'm learning. In the past couple of years or so, I started to learn a lot about different aspects of software and programming. I wanted to be able to track my progress and accomplishments. </br>
    My goal is to, at least post something twice in a month. Hopefully I can even improve on that. </br>
    I'll write about what I am currently learning, what is interesting to me, and try to explain the things that I'm learning to cement that knowledge.

  <p>My open source work started as a fun hobby, but as my tools and blog got more popular, it has turned into a full-time job commitment.
