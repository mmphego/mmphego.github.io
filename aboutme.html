    My name is Mpho Mphego. An Electronic Engineer turned Software Engineer (Now Data Engineer) with a passion for automation, innovation and engineering.

    I have been working with Python professionally since 2013 (8+ years), primarily focusing on backend development and currently employed by <a href="https://capitecbank.co.za"> <strong>Capitec Bank</strong></a><br\> as a Data Engineer.

    <br\>
    I was previously employed by <a href="https://ska.ac.za"> <strong>SKA (Square Kilometer Array) aka SARAO (South African Radio Astronomy
        Observatory)</strong></a> as a <strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong>. Prior to that I was part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Edward_Islands" target="_blank"><strong>Marion Island</strong></a> expeditio, you can read up about my expedition experience here : <a href="https://mmphego.wordpress.com/marion-island-expedition/">Marion Island 71st Expedition</a>
  </p>

  <p class="about-text">
    <span class="fa fa-code about-icon"></span>
    I created this blog to keep track of all if not most of the things I'm learning. In the past couple of years or so, I started to learn a lot about different aspects of software development. I wanted to be able to track my progress and accomplishments. </br>
    My goal is to, at least post something twice in a month. Hopefully I can even improve on that. </br>
    I write about what I am currently learning, things that interest me by doing that I ensure that the knowledge I gain is fully retained and shared to anyone that shares the same interest as me.
  </p>

    My personal and work projects can be accessed on my <strong><a href="https://github.com/mmphego">GitHub page</a></strong>. My personal <a href="/">blog page</a> is a very good place to see some of my work and current things I am learning.

  <p class="about-text">
    <span class="fa fa-file-word-o about-icon"></span>
    I also have an old <a href="https://mmphego.wordpress.com/">Wordpress blog</a>, and most of the posts have been migrated to <a href="https://blog.mphomphego.co.za">blog.mphomphego.co.za</a>, I have left some old travelling documented trips to Marion Island, that I'll leave such that I can have a reference to it somewhere.
