# The Story

Well, that's a wrap. This has been one of the most unpredictable year ever. In this post, I look back at how 2020 was for me and this will just be a little retrospection summary of things that went well and things that did not. I am starting this new tradition of celebrating the end of year as I looking back at some of my highlights of that year.

## TL;DR

## What Went Well

Most of my other goals were financial and personal, however, I would like to reflect on some of my other goals I had set out for 2020.

- I was inspired by [Derek Siversâ€™ /now page movement](https://sivers.org/now3) and started documenting things I was focused on each month from January 2020. This is what I am doing [now.](https://blog.mphomphego.co.za/now)

- Got out of my comfort zone and **became a mentor** to an intern, which of course had its own challenges due to the working from home, apparently I'm brutal and tell it like it is (It's the ADD)!!! 
    One thing I learned from this experience was to be patient with myself and mostly others.

- One of my goals for 2020 was to at least blog twice per month and I managed to publish **17 posts** based on some of my experiences and things learned.

- I started being active on Twitter and some of the people I followed inspired me to take part in the [#100daysofcode challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/). 
    - You can read more about my experiences [here]({{ "/blog/2020/10/17/I-completed-my-100daysofcode-challenge-now-what.html" | absolute_url }} ) while you are at it follow me: @MphoMphego and consider doing the challenge in 2021.


- I wanted to make more YouTube videos this year but I hadn't put a number which I should have. However, I was able to make **3 YouTube video tutorials**: 
    -  If you are reading this please subscribe to my channel 2021 we going big: [https://www.youtube.com/mphomphego1](https://www.youtube.com/mphomphego1)

- Made over **2400+** [Github](www.github.com/mmphego) open&close source contributions (which was less than 2019 @ 2500+), **340+** PR's and **5+** projects

- Won an [Intel Neural Compute Stick](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-movidius-neural-compute-stick.html) from an [AI Face Mask Detection `33 GitHub Stars`](https://github.com/mmphego/face_mask_detection_openvino) project that won the [Deep Learning Superhero App Challenge on hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/contests/DLSuperheroes)

- One thing about me is that when I get bored I get the urge to learn something new even if I hadn't mastered the last one I previously learned (It's the ADD without the H hahaha), with that being said I proudly finished and evolved my skills:

## What Didn't go well

- The sudden change of environment from working in the office and working from home with my wife and 2 kids at home, I had mental health issues, Dude it wasn't fun!!!
- One of my goals was to exercise at least 3 times a week, this didn't go well for obvious reasons my health deteriorated.
- Struggled to split time between learning, working and spending time with my family.
- I felt burnout during the COVID19 lockdown which caused me a lot of stress and sleeps deprivation; but looking on the bright-side I learned new skills while up all night ;-)
- The list goes on and on ...


# My Goals for 2021

I am looking forward to 2021 (2020 won!) with a different perspective and expecting a lot from myself. Some of my tech-related goals for 2021 entails:

- Continue to advance my career at the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) and my goal is to become a **Snr. Software Engineer**.
- Completing **#100DaysOfML challenge** with the primary focus on the [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow - Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40363665-hands-on-machine-learning-with-scikit-learn-keras-and-tensorflow) book I recently bought.
- Work with my son on building and programming the [AlphaBot2 and Raspberry Pi Zero](https://twitter.com/MphoMphego/status/1338402741685727234?s=20) together with the [Intel Neural Compute Stick 2](https://twitter.com/MphoMphego/status/1324097569417560078?s=20) I won.
- Learn more about the fundamentals of MLOps and how to integrate it with software engineering.
- Revive TechTalk Tuesday which is an informal meeting (Meetup), where colleagues/external talent prepares a Tech Talk on Tuesdays during lunchtime.
- Be present on user groups around the world through virtual presentations.

# Conclusion

This was the year of Deep Learning for me, one of the skills I gained was to be patient with myself, to take it easy and always remember that the meaning of life is; If you think about it, is that on the very beginning, the development of the first cell divided into two cells - the sole purposes of life has been to pass on what was learned. There is no higher purpose. So, this year I learned to start passing on the knowledge I have accumulated.
