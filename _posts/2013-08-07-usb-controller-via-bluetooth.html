<p>I have always hated having to move from my couch to my TV stand, To swap my mobile hard drive from my PS3 to PC vice versa.</p>
<p>So out of the blue an idea struck'd me, Why can't I make a USB controller that I will be able to control via my android phone bluetooth.</p>
<p>So i have been working on the schematic. I have also attached it to this post</p>
<p>Now the next thing is software for the MCU and Android bluetooth application.</p>
<p>PS:Schematic was created using Altium Designer.</p>
