<li>This hack ensures that when you log on to a server/pc it will execute a screen session which minimizes the risks of you losing your work in case of network disruptions . Just copy command to your bashrc file and source it.<br />
#Best used when you have to work on a different server via ssh.</p>
<p>[sourcecode language="bash"]if [ &quot;$TERM&quot; != &quot;screen&quot; ]; then<br />
  screen -xRR<br />
fi[/sourcecode]</p>
</li>
<li>This hack enables mouse scrolling and scrollbar history scrolling. Just copy command to your ~/.screenrc file and restart your shell.
<p>[sourcecode language="bash"]<br />
# Enable mouse scrolling and scroll bar history scrolling<br />
defscrollback 5000<br />
termcapinfo xterm* ti@:te@<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
</li>
<li>Ever gotten to a point where, you can't remember a certain command you executed and when you try to grep it from history it suddenly disappeared well, this hack fixes that. Copy and paste following codes to ~/.bashrc and source it.<br />
It creates a file named 'command_log' and logs all executed commands as well as timestamp. Nifty!! very Nifty<br />
[sourcecode language="bash"]<br />
# log every command typed and when<br />
if [ -n &quot;${BASH_VERSION}&quot; ]; then<br />
    trap &quot;caller &gt;/dev/null || \<br />
printf '%s\\n' \&quot;\$(date '+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z')\<br />
 \$(tty) \${BASH_COMMAND}\&quot; 2&gt;/dev/null &gt;&gt;~/.command_log&quot; DEBUG<br />
fi<br />
[/sourcecode]
</li>
</ol>
