<p>While browsing around the Interweb I found a little python poem - Words to-live-by in this world of Pythoning/Pythonian/Pythonization/Pythology or whatever its called.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; import this<br />
<strong>The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters</strong></p>
<p>Beautiful is better than ugly.<br />
Explicit is better than implicit.<br />
<em>Simple is better than complex.</em><br />
Complex is better than complicated.<br />
Flat is better than nested.<br />
Sparse is better than dense.<br />
<em>Readability counts.</em><br />
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.<br />
Although practicality beats purity.<br />
Errors should never pass silently.<br />
Unless explicitly silenced.<br />
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br />
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.<br />
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.<br />
Now is better than never.<br />
Although never is often better than *right* now.<br />
<em>If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.<br />
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<br />
</em>Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</p>
