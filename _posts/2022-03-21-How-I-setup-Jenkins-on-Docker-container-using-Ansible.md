# The Story

Recently, my team found themselves in a situation where they needed to have a staging or development Jenkins environment. The motivation behind the need for a new environment was that we needed a backup Jenkins environment and a place where new Jenkins users could get their hands dirty with Jenkins without having to worry about the environment.
For this task, I decided to pair with my padawan (@AneleMakhaba) as he was a good fit for the task which had been in the backlog for a while.

The objective of the task was to:

- Create a Docker container that would be able to run Jenkins on a local machine

In this post, I will deploy the Jenkins container on an [EC2 instance](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) using Ansible.
