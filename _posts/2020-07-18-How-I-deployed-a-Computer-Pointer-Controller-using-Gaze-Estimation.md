## Story

Imagine controlling your computer mouse pointer using nothing else other than your eyes and head pose. Well stop imagining it.

In post project, I will walk you through a project I created using the IntelÂ® OpenVINO toolkit utilizing the [Gaze Detection model](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_models_intel_gaze_estimation_adas_0002_description_gaze_estimation_adas_0002.html) to control the mouse pointer of my computer.
I used the Gaze Estimation model to estimate the gaze of the user's eyes and change the mouse pointer position accordingly.
This project demonstrated the ability of running multiple models in the same machine and coordinate the flow of data between those models.

To be continued...
