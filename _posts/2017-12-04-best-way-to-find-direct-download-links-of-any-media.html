<strong> Notice: This post does not endorse piracy. It's purpose is merely educational.</strong></p>
<p>We all know that everyone love convinience, by that I mean having to watch your favorite movie, series or let alone listen to your favorite tunes. But getting hold of those contents in this day of age has became cumbersome. I mere Google search of a movie you been dying to watch leads one to spam websites or even worse very disturbing pop-ups like literally - Give it a try. Torrents has always been a NONO for me, reasons are pretty much obvious.</p>
<p>The tricks I am going to list here, with this trick you do not need to access hundrends of websites in search of your favorite media content, and it will not consume hours and hours of your misrable life searching the interweb for your daily dosage of dophamine.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open your favorite browser and open Google</li>
<li>Now type the name of the movie/series you wish want to download and then paste the following code after the movie name.
<ul>
<li>Method 1: <code>"Name of Movie" -inurl:(htm|html|php|pls|txt) intitle:index.of “last modified” (mp4|wma|aac|avi|mkv)</code></li>
<li>Method 2: <code> intitle:index.of? mkv|mp4|avi "Name of the movie"</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Google will display you the search result,<strong> click on either first or second results</strong> and you will get the download link of the movie.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope you found this article helpful, please note I do not endorse piracy this is merely for educational purposes.</p>
