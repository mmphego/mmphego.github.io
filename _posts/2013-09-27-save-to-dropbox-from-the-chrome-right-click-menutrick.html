<p>The era of saving documents on memory cards/sticks is no more, This days everyone who is clued up is using cloud storage. I for one use dropbox for school and related, Google drive for pictures and skydrive for book storage and relevant materials.<br />I have seldom found myself stuck at times as i did not have a mobile storage devices on myself, this led me to use my email as a storage device which in time is not as cool, I know its unappropriated to use that word in everything but it just sounds cool.<br />anyways back to the point, So I have found another way - whereby I can just save data(journals, papers, books, pics you name it.) directly to my dropbox with ease.<br />This way has saved me time and i don't have to carry my flash disk everywhere i go, I just simply save to my dropbox then will retrieve my info later on.</p>
<p>with no further due.</p>
<p>First you'll need to install a copy of <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/download-to-dropbox/mklccdhnpppcmbpbkaanmamjfmmefbnp/" target="_blank">Download to Dropbox for Chrome</a>. Visit the extension page on the Chrome Web Store and then click the Add to Chrome button near the top right-hand side of the extension information.</p>
<p>Next, sign in to your Dropbox account.</p>
<p>You should see a page loading saying the sign-in was successful. Double-check that you are signed in by looking at the Download to Dropbox icon on the Chrome toolbar. There shouldn't be any red or yellow alert indicators on the icon if the extension is ready for use. If there is an alert, you can click the icon and check the errors.</p>
<p>Now you can surf the Web and download files directly to your Dropbox account by right-clicking and selecting "Upload to Dropbox" from the menu. The download status can be checked by clicking the icon for Download to Dropbox in the Chrome toolbar. It's worth noting that the default upload location is Apps/Chrome Downloads, which can be changed by going to the Settings area of the extension (click the button and then the Settings cog icon).</p>
<p>Adding this extension eliminates the need to "follow up" on files you've downloaded that you intend to add to your Dropbox account. You'll be able to save directly to the cloud without much effort at all.</p>
<p>Another reason to use Google Chrome.</p>
