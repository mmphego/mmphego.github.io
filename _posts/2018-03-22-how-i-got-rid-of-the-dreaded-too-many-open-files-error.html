<h1>How I got rid of the dreaded 'Too many open files' ERROR.</h1>
<p>One of the most frustrating thing about continuous integration namely Jenkins, is getting to work in the morning with a happy smile expecting a successful Jenkins build and being faced with the dreaded errors/ or system failures. Not forgetting that these builds take about 3-5 hours to run and run on actual hardware and in real-time/</p>
<p>Going through the console log, you find yourself faced with....</p>
<p>Your build failed because of too many opened files, bla bla blah ...</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1524" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/screenshot_2018-03-22_09-14-23.png" alt="Screenshot_2018-03-22_09-14-23.png" width="1077" height="466" /></p>
<p>After hours of gruesome Googling, I found a solution...</p>
<p>On Ubuntu at least the open files limit for normal users defaults to 1024.Â  So, if you are going to have more than ~1000 simultaneous connections you need to bump this up.</p>
<p><strong>Solution: Raise open file descriptor limits</strong></p>
<p>Here's how to do it on Ubuntu</p>
<p>Open and add the following line.<br />
<code>sudo vim /etc/security/limits.conf</code></p>
<p><code>* soft nofile 16384<br />
* hard nofile 16384</code><br />
The first column describes WHO the limit is to apply for. * is a wildcard, meaning all users. To raise the limits for root, you have to explicitly enter 'root' instead of '*'.</p>
<p>You also need to edit <code>sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-session*</code> and add the following line to the end:</p>
<p><code>session required pam_limits.so</code></p>
<p>logout and then back in before you can use the new max limit, test with</p>
<p><code>ulimit -n</code></p>
<p>Done, No more yada yada Too many open files.</p>
