## The Story

A few weeks ago, I was awarded another opportunity to become a mentor for a new [AWS Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree]() with [Udacity](). This was something I was very excited about, and I was very excited to be able to help others in the field. I have always had an interest in Machine Learning for a while and this is evident in some of my Machine Learning related blog posts.

Having recently been **certified** as an [Azure Data Scientist Associate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-data-scientist/) and showing a good understanding of running experiments, training models and deploying them to [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), I knew that it was a matter of time that I also got a similar skill in [AWS SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) to also be able to implement the same techniques on AWS as with Azure, and eventually receiving the [AWS Machine Learning - Specialist certification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty/).

If you have previously trained and deployed a machine learning model (on-prem), you will know that this process of training and deploying a model is a bit of a challenge. You need to know which model architecture to select, which parameters to tune, which data to use, and how to train the model. Not only do these steps take time, they can also be an extremely frustrating process especially when you are trying out new ideas or projects.

More reason, why I would advice anyone who is interested in Machine Learning to take the time to learn [AWS SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/), and there is no other better place to learn about Machine Learning than through the [Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree](https://imp.i115008.net/VyBNEM).
[Udacity](https://imp.i115008.net/donG17) also has **free courses** that would be beneficial to anyone who is interested in Machine Learning:

- [AWS Machine Learning Foundations Course](https://imp.i115008.net/WDRNnZ)
- [Introduction to Machine Learning Course](https://imp.i115008.net/b32VAb)
- [Machine Learning](https://imp.i115008.net/oe0O1E)

**Note:** Before you run, you need to learn how to crawl with that said I would recommend you to get a copy of [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646) by Urélien Géron, to understand the fundamentals of Machine Learning and the tools and techniques that you will need to use.

If you have read this far, my assumption is that you have somewhat of an idea what AI and ML is and I will not go into the details of those concepts. And now you are probably looking for a quick and easy way to get started with building, tuning, training and deploying a models on the cloud with AWS SageMaker.

This blog post series will detail the steps needed to build, tune, train and deploy a model on AWS SageMaker including how to autoscale the model to handle increased traffic.
