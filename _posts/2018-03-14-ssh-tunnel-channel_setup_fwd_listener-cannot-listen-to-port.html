<p>I was attempting to use SSH to set up a tunnel to my Jenkins server from home, so I typed the following (Like I do in most days):</p>
<p><code>ssh -f -N -L 8080:remote_host:8080 -p 2222 user@host_address</code></p>
<p>…only to be greeted with the error:</p>
<p><code>bind: Address already in use<br />
channel_setup_fwd_listener: cannot listen to port: 8080</code></p>
<p>Whats odd is that I was sure I didn't have anything else listening on that port, but I confirmed it with a quick <code>netstat -anpt | grep '8080'</code>. To my realization nothing was listening on the port.</p>
<p>More strangely, with the SSH session open, I can go to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and see <a href="https://jenkins.io/">Jenkins</a>.</p>
<p>To my realization SSH itself had already opened the port(weird), and was complaining that it couldn’t do it a second time.</p>
<h4>Resolution:</h4>
<p>A simple <code>pkill-9 ssh</code>, saved the day</p>
<h4>work around to avoid above scenario:<em><br />
</em></h4>
<p>So after few Googling and reading up about ssh custom config, mostly from <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-custom-connection-options-for-your-ssh-client" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digitalocean</a></p>
<p>I’ve added the following in my <code>~/.ssh/config file</code>:</p>
<p><code>Host Jenkins<br />
ControlMaster auto<br />
LocalForward 8080 host_ip:8080<br />
Hostname _hostname<br />
User _username<br />
Port _custom port</code></p>
<p>Thereafter a simple,<br />
<code> ssh -f -N -l Jenkins</code>, was all I needed.</p>
<p>Know more: <code>man ssh</code></p>
