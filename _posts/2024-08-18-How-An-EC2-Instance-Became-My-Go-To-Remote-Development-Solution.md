# The Story

Due to strict network security policies enforced by tools like ZScaler causing endless installation failures and security warnings for Python dependencies on local development machine (work laptop). The constant need to reconfigure settings and whitelist packages to bypass these restrictions did not only cause disruption but also pose potential risks to my work laptops security. Faced with these challenges and the alternative being carrying 2x laptops left me with a bitter taste on my mouth. I considered an alternative solution, initially working on a development container. However, even with containers, security warnings persisted. Finally, I decided to shift my development work to a remote environment using an EC2 instance which offered me a more stable and secure solution without constant security warnings.

In this post, I'll share details on how I setup an EC2 instance as a remote development environment using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). This setup has been a ket part of my personal Data Engineering End-to-End project I have been working on and my ongoing learning journey.
