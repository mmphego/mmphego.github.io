    class=\"reblogged-content\">\n\nJust needing to get this down quickly and succinctly...\r\n\r\nThe
    Raspberry Pi is super-fun for me as it's a full OS (Linux, which I really like
    a lot) with Pins! Â Current project: make a (private) website that will let me
    open/close and check my garage door. Â Maybe more on this later.\r\n\r\nSUPER
    frustrating is the inability for a web-server to control the GPIO pins on my Raspberry
    Pi because the web-server is not running as root. Â Really?!? <!--more-->Â The
    only way to address the GPIO pins of the Pi is as sudo / root?!? Â I can't really
    complain all that much because I'm not willing to learn and write the C code required
    for this to happen. Â So I searched and tried and iterated and eventually ended
    up running shell commands from within the web-server scripts because the <a title=\"WiringPi
    by Gordon Henderson\" href=\"http://wiringpi.com/\" target=\"_blank\">awesome
    computer interface programmer Gordon Henderson</a> made a command-line utility
    (gpio) that WILL write to the GPIO pins without being root.\r\n\r\nOn the RaspberryPi.org
    site, Gordon has a nice<a title=\"Elro switch without root\" href=\"http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=32&amp;t=32177\"
    target=\"_blank\"> post of how he setup his Raspberry Pi</a> so that his programs
    can read/write to the GPIO pins without being root. Â I only need the no-root
    part. Â Gordon's methodÂ <em>almost</em>Â worked for me. Â Here's what I ended
    up doing.\r\n\r\n1) Create a script that \"exports\" specific GPIO pins and then
    sets the ownership.\r\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">cat <strong>/usr/local/bin/set_gpio_pins.sh</strong>\r\n\r\n#
    filename: /usr/local/bin/set_gpio_pins.sh &lt;&lt; set as executable (chmod +x)\r\n#\r\n#
    set GPIO pins 17, 22, and 24 to be usable without root access\r\n#  In fact, make
    them accessible to the web-server (www-data) and\r\n#   the 'typical' user (pi).
    \ The 'chmod' allows user 'pi' to write\r\n# This script must be run as root (sudo),
    in root's crontab, or\r\n#   each of the lines in the for-loop need to start with
    'sudo'\r\nfor pin in 17 22 24; do\r\nÂ Â  /usr/local/bin/gpio export $pin out\r\nÂ Â 
    chown -R www-data:pi /sys/devices/virtual/gpio/gpio$pin\r\nÂ Â  chmod -R g+w /sys/devices/virtual/gpio/gpio$pin\r\ndone</pre>\r\n \r\n\r\n2)
    Instead of using /etc/rc.local, I added the running of this script as a cron-job
    so that it runs on boot-up. Â Staring with 'sudo' means this is the crontab for
    the root/superuser (hence, no need for 'sudo' in the set_gpio_pins.sh script).
    Â The \"-e\" brings up the editor.\r\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">sudo crontab
    -e\r\n# at end of file add...\r\n@reboot Â  Â Â Â /usr/local/bin/set_gpio_pins.sh
    Â # file from step #1 above</pre>\r\n \r\n\r\nFINALLY! I can use the pins, inside
    of scripts (ex. Python or PHP or ____), without having to have the webserver run
    as root nor using shell-commands inside a script. Whew.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n </div>\";}"
