# The Story

As a data engineer, one of your task is to ensure that you and everyone in your team is writing efficient and maintainable SQL code. This is crucial to the success of any data-driven project. However, ensuring that your SQL code adheres to best practices can be challenging, especially when working in large teams with engineers from different standards. That’s where automating SQL code quality checks comes in to ensure that the SQL code going to production aligns with a standard (crafted by the engineers).

In this post, I’ll show you how I integrated [SQLFluff](https://sqlfluff.com/), [Pre-Commit](https://pre-commit.com/), and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) into your GitHub workflow to enforce consistent SQL coding standards and catch issues before they reach production. By the end, you’ll have a streamlined, automated process that makes maintaining SQL code quality easy and efficient.
