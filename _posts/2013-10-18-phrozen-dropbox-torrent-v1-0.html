<p>Phrozen DropBox Torrent is a tiny tool which uses the power of the well known Cloud Hosting service DropBox to bypass some restriction in some countries, campusses or companies.</p>
<p>Basically it will grab any dropped torrent file (inside the DropBox path) and automatically start the downloading process from the computer where you installed the freeware.</p>
<p>For example, you could install Phrozen Dropbox Torrent at home, then when you are at work searching (and finding) for something which only exist as a torrent but you then run into problems because your internet may restricted and, as a consequence, you are unable to download that torrent. With Phrozen DropBox Torrent you simply download the torrent file, drop the torrent file in one of the DropBox synchronized paths and then wait few seconds. When the torrent disappears from the DropBox context, it means the download has started from the computer where Phrozen DropBox Torrent is installed.</p>
<p>Note: This is only the very beginning of the project and this project could grow in something much more powerful which not only downloads torrents but will have other interesting features as well (Phrozen DropBox Utilities).</p>
<p>It doesnâ€™t require any torrent client. We use a free torrent downloader called Aria (console), which is very efficient.</p>
