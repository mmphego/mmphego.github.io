# I gave a talk at the DevOpsDays conference the other day!

![Devopsdays]({{ "/assets/devopsdays_logo.png" | absolute_url }})

I recently gave a talk at the 3rd annual [DevOpsDays Cape Town conference](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-cape-town/welcome/) which was held at Woodstock, Cape Town on 20-21 September 2018.
Devopsdays is a worldwide series of technical conferences covering topics of software development, IT infrastructure operations, and the intersection between them. Each event is run by volunteers from the local area.

First of all I would like to give thanks to the organizers, volunteers and sponsors:
- @adrianmoisey
- @cobusbernard
- All the volunteers(@edebeste, et al.)
- Most importantly the [sponsors](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-cape-town/sponsor/)

# My Talk
Being an introvert has it's challenges, and one of the challenges I have is public speaking.
Obviously to overcome those challenges, one has to face them head on. So after hearing about the DevOpsDays Conferences at the previous [Cape Town DevOps Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Cape-Town-DevOps/) that I attended, I was like - **Mpho** you must submit my talk.

Fortunately, the organizers at the @devopsdayscpt liked my talk submission and they gave me the opportunity to tell the world my story.


## Talk: Automated Qualification Testing for the 64 Antennas MeerKAT Correlator-Beamformer

@JoeNuspl gave me this piece of advice, before I hit the lectern and he said *"Just remember, you're paid to be an engineer not a public speaker. Focus on content and tell your story."*, So below is my story.

My talk [abstract](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-cape-town/program/mpho-mphego/), and [conference program](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-cape-town/program) can be found on [Link](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-cape-town/program/mpho-mphego/).

### My Talk: Automated Qualification Testing for the 64 Antennas MeerKAT Correlator-Beamformer
Initially, I planned to include a demo but had technical issues - I will upload the demo on a later stage as it forms part of the series, [*How I configured Jenkins CI server in a Docker container*]({{ site.baseurl }}blog/2018/08/20/How-I-configured-JenkinsCI-server-in-a-Docker-container.html).

## Conclusion
The overall experience was Amazing! the event was very well organised (Thanks to the organizers), great talks, great people, great food and great beer!. It was my second official talk given and I think I did well if I say so myself (Could improve), definitely not my last. Not being a people's person has it's challenges ie I didn't meet as many people as I had hoped I would, but hoping to make new friends at the next meetup or conference.

My only advice would be, if this is something that interests you then get yourself involved with the meetup's and the DevOps community, I highly recommend joining the [Cape Town DevOps Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Cape-Town-DevOps) and the [ZATech Slack Chat](https://zatech.github.io/).

I'll leave you with two of my favourite quotes.
