<p>A while back I was unfortunate in such a way that my HDD that I primarily use as photo archive started having mechanical issues, and before It died on my arms I had the opportunity to backup most of my pictures, however most of them were truncated and had to be discarded and the ones I could recover their filenames where overwritten with random filenames and ascii codes.</p>
<p>For over a while I have neglected my pictures and they just piled up in a single and nameless directory, until I took it against myself to clean them up.</p>
<p>And one of the benefits of using Linux OS is the scripting features.</p>
<p>[code language="bash"]<br />
for i in *;<br />
do d=$(exiftool $i | grep 'Date/Time Original' | cut -f 17 -d ' ');<br />
newd=`echo ${d//:/-}`;<br />
echo $i ${newd} ;<br />
mkdir -p ${newd};<br />
mv -- ${i} ${newd};<br />
done<br />
[/code]</p>
<ol>
<li>write this script to a file named <code>mvByDate.sh</code> in your old directory.</li>
<li>replace the <code>/your/new/directory</code> with your new directory's path</li>
<li>make this file executable with <code>chmod +x mvByDate.sh</code></li>
<li>then execute this file by <code>./mvByDate.sh</code></li>
<li>voila</li>
</ol>
