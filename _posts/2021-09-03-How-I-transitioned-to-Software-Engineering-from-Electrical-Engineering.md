# The Story

The other day, I found myself scrolling through Twitter timeline and stumbled upon a tweet that resonated with me. It was a tweet from @Tebatsomankger2, I took a screenshot and pasted it below. You're also welcome to read the whole thread [here](https://twitter.com/Tebatsomankger2/status/1433138792177754115)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7910856/131979920-bd0d15e1-f752-439e-a9fd-664b0009fb3e.png)

The reason why I am saying it resonated with me is that for the longest time, I too felt the same way. After graduating with an Electrical Engineering diploma and coming from a disadvantaged background, I too hoped that the hard-earned qualification would take me from rags to riches. That dream quickly faded to the abyss when I constantly found myself seeking employment opportunities and when I did get a job the salary was close to nothing basically it paid for my rent and transport (basically living hand to mouth). I constantly questioned myself and my decisions as to why I pursued a career in electrical engineering instead of a degree in something like medicine where career prospects were much higher.

I think my whole world changed when I got an opportunity to go on an expedition where I spent over a year in isolation with other 19 expeditioners and a shitty internet connection. You can read about that adventure on my old blog site [here](https://mmphego.wordpress.com/marion-island-expedition/).

Isolation gave me time to reflect on my life and plan my future. I did not like the person I would be 10 years from then and I had to make changes.

That's when I decided to take a leap of faith and start a career in software engineering, I cannot remember what prompted me but it was probably a YouTube video.

I think what worked for me is that I had a lot of freedom to choose my career path and I was able to choose a career path that was not only fulfilling but also that I could be a better person.
Also, the fact that I had been exposed to programming from my qualification was a huge help, even after failing it 2-3 times (like I said disadvantaged background).

What worked for me was that I was always driven and curious about what I could do and I was always willing to learn new things.

Before I  completely get off-topic (which I usually do), I replied to the tweet above with the following message and was overwhelmed with the number of DMs I received.

At that moment, I decided to write this post which will briefly detail my journey from being an electronic engineering technician to how I became a software engineer and some pointers you can try for yourself.

# My Journey

Mid-2014, I started enrolling for courses on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) and [edx](https://www.edx.org). I was initially interested in learning about the fundamentals of computer science and I was able to get a good grasp of the basics of programming, I gravitated towards Python programming language as the syntax was easier to read.

Some of the courses I took were:
- [Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)
- [Fundamentals of Computing Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computer-fundamentals)
- [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)
- [Introduction to Linux](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-linux)
- [Linux Basics: The Command Line Interface](https://www.edx.org/course/linux-basics-the-command-line-interface)


**Note:** All these courses are **FREE**, with Coursera you can apply for financial aid and get a certificate; which is a win-win situation.

These courses helped me understand the fundamentals of programming and how to write code. I was able to learn how to use the Linux terminal. In 2016 we started seeing a rise in Machine Learning/AI applications and that Python was at the forefront, so in the end, I had made a great choice.

I continue to learn new things and I am always looking for new ways to improve myself.

# Your Journey

I assume that you are reading this post because you are at that point in your life where you want to transition to a different career, it might be software engineering or data science.

Before you continue, **What is your WHY?**.
The reason why I am saying this is because a lot of people want things handed to them on a silver platter and do not want to put in the time and effort to learning something new.

Do yourself a favour and grab a piece of paper and ask yourself the following question:
**Why do I want to do this?**

# Conclusions

One thing I learned is that tech is constantly evolving and one needs to be consistent with their learning. As Les Brown once said, "If you do what is easy your life will be hard. If you do what is hard your life will become easy."

I will come back to this and update it with more resources, if you have any suggestions or recommendations leave a comment below or connect with me on Tweeter @MphoMphego
