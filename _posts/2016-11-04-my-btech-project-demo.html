<p>So after completing my diploma, and it becoming redundant in the working industry. I had to set my eyes on a Bachelor's degree.<br />
Trust me it was not easy, in the sense of being a part-time student, full-time employee, a father, a fiance and being stuck on some island for 15 months then when you come back you're residing in Cape Town and the university in Pretoria.<br />
I think I can write a book with my life's story.</p>
<p>Long story short, I managed to complete my degree within 3.5 years instead of 2 - which was a bonus, And now I have set my eyes on a Master's degree just to challenge myself one thing for sure, one doesn't need to be stagnant in life.<br />
I believe in continuous improvement of oneself.</p>
<p>Let me stop yapping and show you a demo of my Bachelor's project</p>
<p>If you like give thumbs up.</p>
