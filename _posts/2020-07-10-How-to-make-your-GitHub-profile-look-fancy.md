# The Story
Github recently added a new feature, you can finally add a README to your GitHub profile which you can showcase your profile - Kinda like a portfolio page.

In this post, I will show you how you can create your own.

# The Walk-through
Follow this simple steps:

- Goto [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new) and create a repo with your github username (e.g. [https://github.com/mmphego/mmphego](https://github.com/mmphego/mmphego))

- Initialize it with a `README.md` file or create one and push it.
- Add some content in your `README.md`, for instance a banner, links to your blog/LinkedIn, some introduction text.
- `git commit` and `git push` your changes upstream.
- Head over to your GitHub profile and voila!
