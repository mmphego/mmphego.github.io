# The Story

Recently I gave a talk to my colleagues and co-worker on how to use Docker and Docker Compose to build a containerized application. This talk was mostly aimed at beginners, and included a short introduction to the concepts.

I thought it would be a good idea to share this experience with you.

Please do leave a comment if you have any questions or suggestions.

## The Walk-through
