    class=\"reblogged-content\">\n\nWas reading the online book <a href=\"http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/\"
    title=\"Learn Python the Hard way\" target=\"_blank\">Learning Python the Hard
    Way </a>and landed on <a href=\"http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/advice.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">this page</a>, Here's some of the things that jumped out for
    me.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>On Programming</strong>\r\n<blockquote>\r\nWhich programming
    language you learn and use doesn't matter. Do not get sucked into the religion
    surrounding programming languages as that will only blind you to their true purpose
    of being your tool for doing interesting things.\r\n\r\n<strong>Programming as
    an intellectual activity is the only art form that allows you to create interactive
    art.</strong> <strong>You can create projects that other people can play with,
    and you can talk to them indirectly. No other art form is quite this interactive.</strong>
    Movies flow to the audience in one direction. Paintings do not move. Code goes
    both ways.\r\n\r\nProgramming as a profession is only moderately interesting.
    It can be a good job, but you could make about the same money and be happier running
    a fast food joint. You're much better off using code as your secret weapon in
    another profession.\r\n\r\nPeople who can code in the world of technology companies
    are a dime a dozen and get no respect. P<strong>eople who can code in biology,
    medicine, government, sociology, physics, history, and mathematics are respected
    and can do amazing things to advance those disciplines.</strong>\r\n\r\nOf course,
    all of this advice is pointless. If you liked learning to write software with
    this book, you should try to use it to improve your life any way you can. Go out
    and explore this weird, wonderful, new intellectual pursuit that barely anyone
    in the last 50 years has been able to explore. Might as well enjoy it while you
    can.\r\n\r\n-Zed. A. Shaw\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nYou should also be interested
