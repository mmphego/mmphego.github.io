# The Story

This talk is aimed at SysAdmin/DevOps/Devs/SecExperts and/or intermediate Docker users and was motivated by this blog-post: [How I Hardened The Security Of My Docker Environment]({{ "/blog/2021/03/28/How-I-hardened-the-security-of-my-Docker-environment.html" | absolute_url }})

In this video, I am going to be giving you an overview on how to harden the security of your Docker environment and more specifically talk about the Docker attack surface (Docker Client, Host and Registry)!
The first part of this video is going to be about how the Docker client communicates with the Docker Host and then the Docker Image Registry. Thereafter, I will be talking about how to harden the security of your Docker environment and tools recommendations.

I hope you enjoy it!
Please do leave a link/comment if you have any questions or suggestions.

PS: I am not a security expert, just an enthusiast :-)
