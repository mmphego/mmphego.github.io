# Must Watch Talks

## Disclaimer
This post was motivated by "hellerve" repo on GitHub basically a *Fork*.

I did not give any of the talks on the list and am responsible neither for their content nor for their presentation. All links below will direct you to external sites (mostly YouTube, really), be aware of that. If you are one of the people responsible for the talks or the platform presenting it and want it removed, tell me and I'll sort it out with you.

With that said, I also watch a lot of talks and love to share with my friends(If you are reading this then I consider you as a friend), fellows and everyone else. I decided it's time to share my personal list of talks I found helpful and informative.
