My personal website. Visit [https://mmphego.github.io/](https://mmphego.github.io/) to view it, cloned from [https://pinsleepe.github.io/](https://pinsleepe.github.io/)

# How do I clone it locally?

Run `git clone https://github.com/mmphego/mmphego.github.io.git` in the folder where you want to clone it. Then type `jekyll serve` to host the site on a localhost server and refresh it as new changes are made.
