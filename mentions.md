        A compilation of video clips taken during the M71 (2014-2015) Marion Island Expedition.
        19 South Africans spent 13 months on the island doing mostly biological and meteorological research. We were able to observe the full reproductive cycle of the incredible species living or breeding on the island as well as the effect of the four seasons on the beautiful but brutal landscape.
