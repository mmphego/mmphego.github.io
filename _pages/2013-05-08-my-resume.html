<p>I am a Student and Hobbyist at Cape Peninsula University of Technology pursuing a Master's in Electronics and Electrical Engineering. I’ve been into science and engineering most of my life, and thus you’ll notice that all the interesting stuff on this website will revolve around that.</p>
<p>A little more about me is that, I'm a detail-focused Electronics/Software Engineer, leading and contributing to enhance system functionality and end-user productivity. Acknowledged for capacity to tackle challenging issues, analyzes viable alternatives, and provide innovative solutions that reside within clients’ financial and time frameworks. Persistence, personal integrity, and channeled energies are major strengths.</p>
<p>Well that pretty sums it all up.</p>
