summary: |
        I am currently working as a Test & Verification Engineer on Python’s Correlator-Beamformer back-end development packages (mainly corr2 and casperfpga), my main focus is on testing and verifying these packages with Python based Testing Framework and my contribution can be found on  <a href="https://github.com/ska-sa/mkat_fpga_tests">Meerkat CBF Test Framework</a> at the <a href="ska.ac.za">Square Kilometer Array South Africa</a>.

        Having completed a Bachelors in Electronic Engineering, and currently pursuing a Masters. I found that I enjoyed the programming aspects of the course most, hence why I decided to diverge to Programming focusing mainly on Python and CLang.

        I have been working with Python for the past 4+ years mostly on back-end development, I have enjoyed building tools that have proven to save time and improve efficiency as well, some of my work can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/mmphego">GitHub</a> profile.

        * How I keep my skills sharp

        To make sure I am always up on my feet when it comes to keeping myself up with latest tech, I have been working on a little ‘continuous’ project titled <a href="https://github.com/mmphego/Homely">Homely</a> which is a Raspberry Pi + <a href="https://github.com/mmphego/DSTV_A6_esp8266_IRremote">ESP8266</a> + Amazon Alexa based Home Automation System. The project is primarily written in Python and a bit of Clang, including HTML/CSS and Android.

        To keep my knowledge base updated, I have enrolled on various MOOC's offered by Edx, Coursera and Udacity, and have attended conferences/meetup's as well as watching various <a href="https://github.com/mmphego/programming-talks/blob/Watched-talks">Youtube tuts and lectures </a>.

        * What I want to do next

        I would like to work on projects that are already set to grow big and have scaling issues. I want to work with people that share the same passion as me and with similar interests, especially in what they do such that I can also learn from them and improve where necessary and hopefully teach others as a way of giving back.

        My primary focus is building my Python knowledge base and also focusing more on building my reputation around these tools Ansible, AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins and <a href="https://xebialabs.com/assets/files/infographics/periodic-table-of-devops-tools-v3.pdf">other tools</a>.
